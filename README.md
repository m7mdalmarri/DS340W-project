# Apartment Price Prediction

### Introduction:
This project is inspired by the famous House Price prediction project on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) 
There are many data files in this project, many of them are were older versions of me working on the project, hence they are unnecessary. Instead of deleting them I have kept them just for reference in case they were needed. I will list the files which are useful here in this section (files for the final submission of the project.)
Necessary:
cleaned_property_data.csv
data_cleaning.ipynb
data_cleaning.py
data_collection.py
data_exploration.ipynb
dubai_house_prediction_modified (2).ipynb
properties.csv

Unnecessary:
ML_Six_Models.ipynb (older version of me working on the models.)
data_modeling.ipynb (the first modeling file I got when I found the code, not related to my paper.)
dubai-house-prediction.ipynb (older version of the models, when most of them were overfitting, contacted the professor and fixed them in the modified file.)
properties_data.csv (older version of the data, not needed.)
